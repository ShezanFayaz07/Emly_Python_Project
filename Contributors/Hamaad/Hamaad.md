🎮 Hangman Game – Display & Game Loop Module (Person 3)
📌 Overview

This module is my contribution to the team-based Python Hangman game project.
My responsibility (as Person 3) was to implement the game loop, word display logic, and final result handling, while integrating with shared core functions written by teammates.

This file handles:

Displaying the word progress (_ _ a _ _)

Tracking remaining attempts

Running the main game loop

Showing win/lose results

Coordinating user guesses with the core game logic

The core logic functions are imported from Main_Checked_Functions.py, which is maintained by the team.

🧠 Features Implemented
✅ 1. Word Progress Display

Shows guessed letters and hides unknown ones using _.

Example output:

_ _ a _ _ | ===> Attempts Left: 5

Implemented in:

displayWordProgress(word, guessed_letters, attempts_left)
✅ 2. Game Loop Controller

Controls the flow of the game:

Initializes the game state

Repeatedly asks the user for input

Processes guesses

Updates attempts and progress

Stops when the user wins or loses

Implemented in:

gameLoop()
✅ 3. Win / Lose Condition Check

Checks if:

The user has guessed all letters (Win)

The user has no attempts left (Lose)

Implemented in:

checkWinCondition(guessed_letters, selected_word)
checkLoseCondition(attempts_left)
✅ 4. Final Result Display

Displays colored win/lose messages using ANSI color codes:

🎉 Win → Green

❌ Lose → Red

Implemented in:

showFinalResult(is_win, word)

🔗 Dependencies (Team Integration)

This file depends on functions defined in:

from Main_Checked_Functions import *

Which provides:

initializeGameState()

getUserGuess()

processGuess()

Color constants like Green, Red, White

This design keeps:

Core logic → centralized

UI & game flow → modular and maintainable

▶️ How to Run

From the project root directory:

python Contributors/Hamaad/Hamaad_Code.py

Make sure:

Main_Checked_Functions.py exists in the project root

Python is installed

You are running the command from the root folder of the repo

🧪 Sample Game Flow
_ _ _ _ _ | ===> Attempts Left: 5
Enter your guess: a
{'a'} set() 5
_ a _ _ _ | ===> Attempts Left: 5
Enter your guess: z
{'a'} {'z'} 4
_ a _ _ _ | ===> Attempts Left: 4
...
